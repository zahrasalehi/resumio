so what you should do? you may ask. follow the steps bellow:   

1. make an account in openai.com
2. know the "careless whisper" music (optional but recommended)
3. create an api key in [openAI](platform.openai.com/api-keys)
4. pull this project while you sing the song (also optional. u can make ur own. u dont need my proj. its just here to show off)
5. put the api-key in the last line of settings (if u did pull my project.)
6. make sure to install the requirements in a virtualenv (or dont. idc)
